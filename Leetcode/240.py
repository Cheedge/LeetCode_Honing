240. Search a 2D Matrix II
Medium

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value target in an m x n integer matrix matrix.
This matrix has the following properties:

Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.

Example 1:

Input:  matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]],
        target = 5
Output: true
Example 2:

Input:  matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]],
        target = 20
Output: false


Constraints:

m == matrix.length
n == matrix[i].length
1 <= n, m <= 300
-109 <= matrix[i][j] <= 109
All the integers in each row are sorted in ascending order.
All the integers in each column are sorted in ascending order.
-109 <= target <= 109
